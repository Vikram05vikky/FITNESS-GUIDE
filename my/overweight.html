              <h2>Calorie intake must lie in range of 1600-2400 per day.</h2><br>

              <h2><strong>üçáAdd Protein to Your Diet</strong></h2><br>When it comes to weight loss, protein is the king of nutrients.

              Your body burns calories when digesting and metabolizing the protein you eat, so a high-protein diet can boost metabolism by up to 80‚Äì100 calories per day
              
              A high-protein diet can also make you feel more full and reduce your appetite. In fact, some studies show that people eat over 400 fewer calories per day on a high-protein diet.
              
              Even something as simple as eating a high-protein breakfast (like eggs) can have a powerful effect.<br><br>

              <h2><strong>ü•≠Avoid Processed Foods</strong></h2><br>
              Processed foods are usually high in added sugars, added fats and calories.

What‚Äôs more, processed foods are engineered to make you eat as much as possible. They are much more likely to cause addictive-like eating than unprocessed foods.<br><br>

              <h2><strong>üçâStock Up on Healthy Foods and Snacks</strong></h2><br>
              By always having healthy food available, you reduce the chances of you or other family members eating unhealthy.

There are also many healthy and natural snacks that are easy to prepare and take with you on the go.

These include yogurt, whole fruit, nuts, carrots,and hard-boiled eggs.<br><br>

              <h2><strong>üçãDrink Water</strong></h2><br>There is actually truth to the claim that drinking water can help with weight loss.

Drinking 0.5 liters (17 oz) of water may increase the calories you burn by 24‚Äì30% for an hour afterward.<br><br>

              <h2><strong>üçç Limit Your Intake of Refined Carbs</strong></h2><br>Refined carbs are carbs that have had most of their beneficial nutrients and fiber removed.

The refining process leaves nothing but easily digested carbs, which can increase the risk of overeating and disease.

The main dietary sources of refined carbs are white flour, white bread, white rice, sodas, pastries, snacks, sweets, pasta, breakfast cereals, and added sugar.
<br><br>
              <h2><strong>üçåCount Calories Once in a While</strong></h2><br>
                Being aware of what you‚Äôre eating is very helpful when trying to lose weight.
                
                There are several effective ways to do this, including counting calories, keeping a food diary or taking pictures of what you eat.<br><br>

                <h2><strong>üçè Eat More Slowly</strong></h2><br>
                  If you eat too fast, you may eat way too many calories before your body even realizes that you are full.
                  
                  Faster eaters are much more likely to develop obesity, compared to those who eat more slowly.<br><br>

                  <h2><strong>üçì Add Eggs to Your Diet</strong></h2><br>
Eggs are the ultimate weight loss food. They are cheap, low in calories, high in protein and loaded with all sorts of nutrients.<br><br>

                  <h2><strong>üçàGet Enough Sleep</strong></h2><br>
                    Getting enough sleep is incredibly important for weight loss, as well as to prevent future weight gain.
                    
                    Studies have shown that sleep-deprived people are up to 55% more likely to develop obesity, compared to those who get enough sleep. This number is even higher for children.
                    
                    This is partly because sleep deprivation disrupts the daily fluctuations in appetite hormones, leading to poor appetite regulation.<br><br>

                    <h2><strong>üçáUse Smaller Plates for Unhealthy Foods</strong></h2><br>
                      The typical food plate is larger today than it was a few decades ago.
                      
                      This trend could contribute to weight gain, since using a smaller plate may help you eat less by making portions look larger.
